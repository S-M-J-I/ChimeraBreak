## 🔍 Overview

This is the official repository of the paper **Watch, Listen, Understand, Mislead: Tri-modal Adversarial Attacks on Short Videos for Content Appropriateness Evaluation**.

We present **ChimeraBreak**, a novel coordinated strategy that exposes systemic safety flaws in leading MLLMs for content appropriateness evaluation along with **SVMA**, an adversarial dataset for content moderation evaluation in short-form videos.

This repository contains:
- Links to the **SVMA (Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial) dataset**
- Code to reproduce the **ChimeraBreak tri-modal attack pipeline**
- Evaluation scripts with **ASR metrics**, **ethical reasoning scores**, and **hallucination analysis**

📝 **Accepted at the SVU Workshop @ ICCV 2025**

The repository is structured as follows:
```bash
ChimeraBreak/
├── data/                  # annotation and hf_pipeline script
├── notebooks/             # Contains all attack and judge notebooks with eval. metrics
├── utils/                 # Contains annotation prompts and synth labeller scripts
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```


## 📂 Dataset
The SVMA dataset can be accessible through: 
- 🤗 [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/smji/SVMA-dataset)
- <img width=16 src='https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-and-brands/512/189_Kaggle_logo_logos-512.png' /> [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smjishanulislam/svmaa-bench)


## 🛠️ Pipelines

The code pipelines are available [here](./notebooks/), capable of running on a single GPU. If you're working on a notebook cloud environment (Kaggle, Colab etc.), there's no need to install any libraries as they all come with the notebook environments. Some environments do need the groq cloud installation.

**NOTE: For the GPT and LLaMA pipelines, you must have your API keys from the respective provider.**
